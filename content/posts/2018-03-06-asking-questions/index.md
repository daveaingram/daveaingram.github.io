I just finished reading an excellent article on [Better Brainstorming in HBR](https://hbr.org/2018/03/better-brainstorming). The basic premise is that instead of asking a question and brainstorming answers, you brainstorm better questions. This leads to more open creativity and broader participation from more people.

> "When you're a student, you're judged by how well you answer questions. Somebody

> But in life, you're judged by how good your questions are."

This got me thinking: What areas in my life could I be asking better questions?
For me, I think about my life in the context of:

* Family
* Myself
* Work

In work / business, we use brainstorming often enough that the applications seem pretty clear. I can certainly apply this while working on new products or when trying to determine the best path forward with a software feature or with an organizational challenge. When we moved down to Charleston though, we used a business technique ([SWOT analysis](/moving-to-charleston) -- nerdy, I know) in order to help make our decision, so I'm wondering how I can apply this to my non work life as well. So with my family life and thinking about myself, here are some questions I can think of:

* What are some things you're doing today that you'll regret in 6 months?
* What are some things you're not planning to do today that you'll wish you had 6 months from now?
* Is my family happy today?
* What could I do today for my kids health? What about my own?
* Am I living up to my potential?
* If I could make different choices this year than I did last year, what would they be?
* Is there anything stopping me from making those choices today?
* What's the most important thing you could do right now?

Ok, with that last question .. I'm going to walk away from my computer and go play with my 5 year old.
