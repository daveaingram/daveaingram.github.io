The other day my niece asked me what the steps are of the scientific method.
I responded with "form a hypothesis and run an experiment", but
she wasn't satisfied. There was something with a "P" word in there and she
wanted to get all of the steps right. When I googled the steps, numerous
elementary school websites appeared, expounding on the steps of the
scientific method, which both gave me hope for our next generation of scientists,
and also got me wondering about who else was missing some steps from the scientific
method.

I was thinking about this exchange later, and how essential it is for marketers
to think about and follow the steps of the scientific method when working on their
websites and other marketing materials. The proliferation of A/B testing tools over
the past few years has made one step much easier, but the value of these tools is
greatly diminished without a proper grounding in the scientific method.

So without further adieu, here are the steps as defined [on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method):

1. Make Observations
2. Think of Interesting Questions
3. Formulate Hypotheses
4. Develop Testable Predictions
5. Gather Data to Test Predictions
6. Refine, Alter, Expand or Reject Hypotheses
7. Repeat 4 through 6 as necessary
8. Develop General Theories

I want to talk to each one of these, but the tl;dr of this article is that
most examples I see focus only on running lots of experiments (step 5), but they miss
doing it in such a way that general theories can be established. This is a greatly
missed opportunity and should be remedied post haste.

## Make Observations

You'll never see anything interesting unless you stop, open your eyes, and pay
attention. Opportunities for getting to know your audience abound in both the
physical world and online. Surveying your users and performing user testing
(made far easier with services like [usertesting.com](http://usertesting.com)) are
excellent places to start. Web analytics tools such as [Google Analytics](http://google.com/analytics)
or [Kissmetrics](http://kissmetrics.com) are also indispensable in this regard.

There are entire professions dedicated to both user testing and advanced analytics,
and this step should be taken very seriously. If you're not taking enough time
on this today, be sure to block off time to just stop and observe.

## Think of Interesting Questions

As you observe, questions will undoubtedly begin to form. Write them down and
continue to ask more. If you see something interesting, ask why, then ask why
again. In fact, [ask why five times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) and
you'll undoubtedly get somewhere of interest.

## Formulate Hypotheses

Only with a well formed hypothesis will you be able to make accurate statements
in following steps. A good hypothesis has the end game of a general theory in
mind, not just a question of "which image will work better in my call to action?"

A good hypothesis could look like "my audience will respond better to casual
than formal language." What makes this a good one? It leads to easily testable
predictions as well as the potential of a general theory.

## Develop Testable Predictions

A testable prediction is a smaller unit than a hypothesis. In other words, if
the hypothesis says "I think this is the general rule", the prediction says
"using this specific piece of language will perform better than this other
specific piece of language." Once you get that far, you're ready to launch an
experiment.

## Gather Data to Test Predictions

Running the actual experiment can be done in many different ways. There are
dedicated A/B testing solutions such as [Optimizely](http://optimizely.com) or
[Visual Website Optimizer](http://vwo.com) for the web, but many other tools
include A/B testing such as personalization solutions, email marketing tools
and landing page tools. There are also many open source testing frameworks that
can be used to perform this step.

The important part is that you set up a system that allows you to run a lot of
tests often. This will pay dividends over time, as you'll see in the next steps.

## Refine, Alter, Expand or Reject Hypotheses

A single experiment isn't enough to form a general theory or to reject a hypothesis.
There are far too many confounding conditions for that to be the case. For example,
let's say you run an experiment on your home page using the hypothesis that friendly
language is better than formal language, and your testable prediction is that
the phrase "Hey y'all, how can we help?" will perform better than "Visit our
support page for assistance". It is indeed true that one phrase is more casual
and the other more formal, but perhaps the former phrase is too colloquial for
your audience or it has gone too far. Casual language _in general_ may indeed
be better than formal, but not in this _specific_ case.

Other things can "go wrong" with your test as well. For example, a large conference
in the Southern United States during the week that you run this test may lead to
a large group of people finding the "hey y'all" language to be preferable, but
the next week as the characteristics of your audience change, this can no longer
be the case. So as you see results from an initial test, you should refine and
expand your original hypothesis to get to something sufficiently accurate that
can be answered. Surprising effects can also be found in this way, often leading
to cases where personalization can be employed to speak to different kinds of
people in different ways.

## Repeat 4 through 6 as necessary

Eventually you'll want to either accept or reject your overall hypothesis, and
the importance of the question will help dictate how many different tests should
be run. For example, if you're trying to determine the overall tone of language
to use in all marketing materials, this warrants many carefully planned tests
as this could effect the overall trajectory of your business. If, however, you're
simply trying to determine the optimal size or color of a specific button, the
risk of getting that wrong is likely smaller and can be answered in a few short
iterations.

## Develop General Theories

General theories are the gold you are mining for when embarking on an optimization
plan. In the physical sciences, generalized theories about physics led to a world
where man could walk on the moon. While perhaps less lofty, generalized theories
of audience behavior can lead to far greater benefits in business than simply
testing everything you can think of. If you can prove over many experiments that
a certain tone of voice in your marketing material truly leads to a substantial
lift in conversions, then you can use that knowledge in all your materials and
move on to testing other questions.

## In Conclusion

Running lots of experiments can have some value, but keeping in mind the greater
picture and thinking like a scientist will provide far greater rewards in the
long term. Work towards general theories about your brand, your market or your
audience and you will get far more out of your investment in optimization and
personalization.
