&lt;p&gt;It really has. As I sign off today, I&apos;m also signing off from my nearly 5 years at Acquia. I couldn&apos;t even begin to make it through the list of all of the people I want to thank for all they&apos;ve taught, given and helped me to become. So if you&apos;re reading this, you know who you are. Thank you. I&apos;ve been reminiscing in my last weeks though, so if you care to read the very brief story of my time at Acquia, here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined Acquia in 2013 as the Solutions Architect for the Southeast. At the time we were 300 or so employees, headquartered in Burlington, and the SA team was just over 10 people. There was no employee in Southeast aside from one sales guy, and I came on to help explain Drupal and Acquia&apos;s products to prospective customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went to DrupalCon in Portland, OR that year, I wasn&apos;t specifically looking for a job, and I didn&apos;t know what a Solutions Architect was. I met Rick Vugteveen on I think the first evening though and we got to chatting and he asked if I&apos;d ever considered working at Acquia. I knew Acquia, but hadn&apos;t given it that much thought. As we discussed the available roles, he convinced me that an SA was a pretty great thing to be and that I should come and talk to some other folks at the Acquia booth the next day. (I found out soon after I started that Acquia pays referral bonuses if you help recruit people, but I still choose to believe that Rick liked me and thought I&apos;d be a good addition to the company.) Anyway, I chatted with a bunch of a good people and decided to give things a whirl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 3 weeks later I wrapped up some projects I was working on and headed off to Boston for on-boarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About two months in, I had spent time with enough customers to catch the buzz around personalization and I was less than excited about the story we told at the time. I heard some other folks talking about this as well and started putting some ideas out there. As I&apos;d been doing Drupal development for a number of years, I decided to sketch out an architecture and write a simple Drupal module one weekend that would handle some basic personalization. From that effort, the (Personalize Module)[drupal.org/project/personalize] was born, and then later the full Acquia Lift product. Once the momentum started building, I worked with my good friend and colleague Katherine Bailey for several months before we had anyone else on the team, and we built out a good part of the MVP for Lift. We had a few others join the team and eventually rolled out Lift V1 in February of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued to work as an SA during this time, but as we got closer to launch my time rolled more and more into Product and I was spending less time doing anything unrelated to personalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, at the end of 2014, we made the decision to move from Charlotte, NC where we were living at the time and move up to Boston to take on a full time Product role and work towards the next major version of Lift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team had already grown considerably, and my time in Boston allowed me to work much more closely with an incredible number of amazing people. We rolled out Lift 2 soon after with some decent UX updates, but the real goal was already insight, to revamp the UI and architecture entirely. We rolled out what we internally called &quot;Lift 3&quot; at our Engage conference in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the Lift launch, I started working on a new but related project that we eventually called &quot;Journey&quot;, and just one year later we launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-journey&quot;&gt;Acquia Journey&lt;/a&gt;, a tool for orchestrating omni-channel user experiences in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned an incredible amount about what it takes to build and manage a software product, and made my fair share of mistakes along the way. I&apos;m proud of what we accomplished and am honored to have worked with such an amazing team across all of Acquia along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I already wrote, we decided after considerable deliberation to &lt;a href=&quot;/moving-to-charleston&quot;&gt;move back South to Charleston, SC&lt;/a&gt;. I knew it would be difficult to keep up my momentum as a Product Manager while working remotely, but wanted to give it my best shot. It turned out to indeed be a big challenge to stay well connected to HQ through a series of management changes, and I decided it was time to move on to new adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, today is my last day of the Acquia chapter of my life. I&apos;m going to leave what&apos;s next as a bit of a cliff hanger, partly for the suspense, and partly because I&apos;m still working out the details. But what&apos;s life without a little adventure?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Newtonian explanation of Agile]]></title><description><![CDATA[So here's a fun little idea.

I was in a great meeting a few months back, where we were using a lot of physics concepts to discuss business: acceleration, momentum, velocity, and so on. It hit me that maybe there&apos;s more to this use of language and I&apos;ve been mulling it over ever since. To get right down to basics, let&apos;s look at
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion&quot;&gt;Isaac Newtons 3 laws of motion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;inertia&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#inertia&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Inertia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the exact law translates to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every material universe, the motion of a particle in a preferential reference frame Φ is determined by the action of forces whose total vanished for all times when and only when the velocity of the particle is constant in Φ. That is, &lt;em&gt;a particle initially at rest or in uniform motion&lt;/em&gt; in the preferential frame Φ &lt;em&gt;continues in that state unless compelled by forces to change it.&lt;/em&gt; (emphasis added)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For practical discussion, let&apos;s just stick to the part about &quot;an object in motion stays in motion&quot;. If you look at big businesses or government organizations, it&apos;s easy to see that something akin to this principle is at work in human systems as well as physical ones. &quot;Organizational Inertia&quot; gets established by rules, procedures, social norms, rigid software and the desire of individuals to not rock the boat or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simplypsychology.org/milgram.html&quot;&gt;question authority&lt;/a&gt;. The net result is that if you do nothing, you&apos;ll generally just keep moving in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;f--ma&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#f--ma&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;F = ma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newton&apos;s second law of motion states that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That one&apos;s a mouthful, but &lt;code&gt;Force = Mass * Acceleration&lt;/code&gt; also means that &lt;code&gt;Acceleration = Force / Mass&lt;/code&gt;, which is to say that if you want something to move faster, you can either increase the net force applied to it, or you can decrease its mass. Decreasing mass in business and in life generally translates into breaking big problems into small ones so that you can move them around more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so what about the 3rd law?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;ve ever been in a situation where you want something to change, you know that the more mass / momentum that thing has, the harder it&apos;s going to be to get it to change. This is why we want smaller problems for the sake of solving the problems. But this also means that when you try to make something change, there&apos;s going to be push back. If you&apos;ve broken the problem into something small enough, the blowback to you will be less, and you&apos;ll probably keep a lot more of your sanity and emotional wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;stopping-and-changing-directions&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#stopping-and-changing-directions&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Stopping and changing directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how much force does it take to stop something? Well, we can calculate it exactly with a bit of Kinematics at Newton&apos;s second law above, but if you really want to follow along, this guy can explain it better than me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
          &lt;div
            class=&quot;gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper&quot;
            style=&quot;padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&quot;
          &gt;
            &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vWGAKpP_WcE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen style=&quot;

            left: 0;
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
          &quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we&apos;re in business here and we&apos;re really just going for the principal, which is that an object moving twice as fast will take &lt;em&gt;four times as much stopping power&lt;/em&gt;. That&apos;s an exponential increase, and gives us all the more reason to check if something&apos;s working before it&apos;s plowing along like a freight train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agile works in software development and numerous other areas in life and business because it keeps problems small enough that your team can accelerate quickly, and stop or change direction when required. It&apos;s really fairly intuitive, and if you&apos;ve tried it you&apos;ve seen the advantages as well. Still, it&apos;s nice to know that Newton&apos;s got your back.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Asking Questions]]></title><description><![CDATA[I just finished reading an excellent article on  Better Brainstorming in HBR .

The basic premise is that instead of asking a question and brainstorming answers, you brainstorm better questions. This leads to more open creativity and broader participation from more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When you&apos;re a student, you&apos;re judged by how well you answer questions. Somebody
else asks the questions, and if you give good answers, you&apos;ll get a good grade.
But in life, you&apos;re judged by how good your questions are.&quot;
-- &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2018/03/better-brainstorming&quot;&gt;Robert Langer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking: What areas in my life could I be asking better questions?
For me, I think about my life in the context of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In work / business, we use brainstorming often enough that the applications seem pretty clear. I can certainly apply this while working on new products or when trying to determine the best path forward with a software feature or with an organizational challenge. When we moved down to Charleston though, we used a business technique (&lt;a href=&quot;/moving-to-charleston&quot;&gt;SWOT analysis&lt;/a&gt; -- nerdy, I know) in order to help make our decision, so I&apos;m wondering how I can apply this to my non work life as well. So with my family life and thinking about myself, here are some questions I can think of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some things you&apos;re doing today that you&apos;ll regret in 6 months?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some things you&apos;re not planning to do today that you&apos;ll wish you had 6 months from now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is my family happy today?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What could I do today for my kids health? What about my own?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I living up to my potential?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I could make different choices this year than I did last year, what would they be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there anything stopping me from making those choices today?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&apos;s the most important thing you could do right now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, with that last question .. I&apos;m going to walk away from my computer and go play with my 5 year old.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Moving To Charleston]]></title><description><![CDATA[It was time.

&lt;p&gt;We had been talking about it since we came up, but started thinking about it more seriously after searching for a house to buy (we had been renting) but not finding something we liked. Then it hit me: It was going to get harder to move away from New England the longer we stayed there. Why? Because our oldest was already in 3rd grade and our youngest will start Kindergarten next year. Acton was feeling more like home in some ways, but still too far from home (and family) for us to want to fully put down roots. So, if it was going to just get harder over time, then the sooner the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of family, living far away is hard. We were spending a lot of time and money traveling down South for holidays, and still only seeing family a couple of times a year. That was hard on the kids and us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first visited Charleston for Christmas of 2011. The photo doesn&apos;t show it, but this was during a pretty rough time in our lives and there was no guarantee we were going to hold our young family together.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ve come back quite a few times on vacation since then and thought about living here since then. Once we started looking more intently, we started weighing all the things we liked and disliked about it against everything we liked and disliked about being in MA. Some of the other big things we liked about the Charleston area:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Historic area (one of the things we loved about Boston)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weather (which we also liked in Boston, except for like November and February/March)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big enough town that I can find people working in lots of different kinds of tech&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost of living (not quite as cheap as we were thinking it would be, but still cheaper than MA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food. The food here is excellent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expected downside was schools. Massachusetts has absolutely amazing schools. Once we started looking at schools in this area though, we found that Mount Pleasant also has really good schools, and we came down and toured several and decided to give things a try. We&apos;ve been quite happy with that part of the decision so far as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we&apos;ve been here a few months and I thought it would be worth reflecting on things I&apos;ve learned in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving up to Boston was an awesome opportunity. It was only feasible for us because I chased a series of opportunities that came up with my company. The opportunity hadn&apos;t ended, but in continuing to evaluate our life priorities, we decided it was time to move on. I&apos;m incredibly thankful for my time there and I&apos;ll carry those experiences with me the rest of my life. I could have kept going with my career in Boston, but that would have been at the cost of family, so it was time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were getting increasingly confident that a move down was the right thing, but our kids had never been here while thinking about living here, so we took a crazy weekend trip down (we drove on a Thursday and back up on a Monday) We toured 5 schools and lined up a realtor to look at 7 or 8 houses the next day. We went to the beach and took a horse drawn carriage tour. By the end of the weekend, everyone was confident it was a good plan and the kids were on board. We found a house we liked and made an offer. There were obviously numerous hurdles to get over still, but we had enough data to feel confident we were making the right decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, if you come visit, get the shrimp and grits. They&apos;re different at every restaurant, but they&apos;re always delicious.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[n-Dimensional Experiences]]></title><description><![CDATA[My motto of late has become "personalization is hard."

It&apos;s true though. Personalization is hard. But the statement isn&apos;t meant to discourage, and I remain a strong advocate that personalized experiences are the way of the future. Albert Einstein is quoted as saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had an hour to solve a problem I&apos;d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following that logic, let&apos;s spend a few minutes thinking about why personalization is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-limits-of-a-3d-world&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#the-limits-of-a-3d-world&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Limits of a 3D World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live our physical lives in 3 dimensions. Not a profound statement, but it leads to some fairly strong limitations. We often look at 2-dimensional data in the form of line charts or bar graphs. Creative individuals have devised creative ways to move past this limitation by showing more dimensions in color, shape and size, and by using software to render 3D models. Even animation and &lt;a href=&quot;http://listen.hatnote.com/&quot;&gt;sound&lt;/a&gt; (including pitch, timbre and duration) can be used. At best, this gets us to about 10 dimensions, but then the limits of human focus and short term memory step in to block us from even getting this far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building personalized digital experiences is problematic, precisely because it brings us into a high dimensional space which becomes very hard to visualize and understand. Let&apos;s pick just a few of these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Region&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Past Purchase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time of Day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Day of Week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Season&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last Few Page Views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current Mood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh oh, that&apos;s already 11. So even with the most sophisticated data visualizations we can imagine, we&apos;re already beyond the scope of holding all the possibilities in mind. Fortunately, we are not without options. The remainder of this post will explore a few of the ways we can handle this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;black-box-algorithms&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#black-box-algorithms&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Black Box Algorithms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematicians and Data Scientists deal with extremely high dimensional data sets all the time. Here we&apos;re discussing more than 10, which is already hard, but with the right algorithms and the speed of computers, we can run computations with literally millions of dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These algorithms can be extremely effective in making predictions about the future, but they can also be deceptive and lead to a variety of troubles. To take an extreme example, one of the major factors of the financial crisis of 2008 was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/oct/16/computing-software-financial-crisis&quot;&gt;software working in a very high dimensional space&lt;/a&gt;, to the point where the humans building and using the software didn&apos;t discover the errors until it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dimensionality-reduction&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#dimensionality-reduction&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Dimensionality Reduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to understand what happens inside of the black boxes described above, a range of techniques exist to reduce the number of dimensions used in calculations and to discover the most important or influential dimensions in any data set. Some techniques, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis&quot;&gt;Principal Component Analysis&lt;/a&gt; do very little to aid human intuition, and are used much more for simplifying computation. On the other hand, many machine learning and statistical techniques such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression&quot;&gt;Linear Regression&lt;/a&gt;, can produce--as a part of their output--information which tells us which variables used in a learned model were the most relevant in predicting whatever outcome we were trying to predict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These latter techniques, in the hands of a skilled Data Scientist or used properly in the right software can inform us which of the hundreds of dimensions that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be used in Personalization really &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;higher-dimensional-uis&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#higher-dimensional-uis&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Higher Dimensional UIs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Personalization software in particular, understanding what happens on a website or other experience in all of these different dimensions is a big challenge. I can easily toggle my website between its different languages, or even just have different sites for different languages. This is easy enough. But if I segment my visitors across several dimensions as well, I need preview and management capabilities in order to understand what can be happening at any given time in any area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the near future I&apos;ll be posting a lot more about the new User Interface coming out with the latest version of &lt;a href=&quot;www.acquia.com/Acquia-Lift&quot;&gt;Acquia Lift&lt;/a&gt;. While of course technically still a 2D UI, we&apos;ve used a mental model of allowing the user to zoom in, zoom out, and swipe side to side to work with a much larger canvas. A marketer can select any area that contains personalization, &quot;zoom in&quot;, and switch between the different variations. In the next moment, the user can &quot;impersonate&quot; a site visitor of a particular segment and see all of those personalized areas update with a preview of what will be shown by the decision engine. While not quite the UI used by Tom Cruise in Minority Report, it&apos;s probably the closest thing that I&apos;ve ever used to that model. Anyway, stay tuned for updates on that front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the techniques or software used to help manage it, the reality is that the digital experiences we create today are no longer 2D. This is not a solved problem, but it&apos;s a fun one to work on, and I look forward to seeing all of the different ways that organizations approach it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Personalize for Trust]]></title><description><![CDATA[Personalization is about relationships.

Relationships, about trust. Much has been written about the good, bad and ugly of personalization, but all too often, these conversations focus simply on technology or perhaps general tricks to “make things more personal.” The technology that powers digital personalization is simply enabling better marketers and content creators to more closely approximate face to face relationship building, and relationships can be good, bad and ugly, which is really the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a friend, colleague or acquaintance shares information with us, we have unspoken social contracts regarding how and when we can use that information, which, when followed, lead to deeper relationships. Ignore those rules of engagement though, and your relationship will be short lived. So put aside all thoughts of the technology and techniques for a moment, and keep these basics in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-be-forgetful&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#dont-be-forgetful&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Don’t Be Forgetful&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you ever forget a close friends birthday? An anniversary? How about the name of a new colleague or the names of their spouse or kids? These memory slips can usually be forgiven once or twice, but if you keep this up, the relationship will be short lived. On the flip side, research shows that using someone’s name both &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1647299/&quot;&gt;in conversation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2725251&quot;&gt;in email marketing&lt;/a&gt; can have positive effects. The more details you can remember and respond (appropriately) to, the more that relationship can grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s great remember the details that someone tells you, bombarding a new acquaintance with personal questions that go beyond acceptable social norms can be a very quick way to end a relationship as well. Asking a stranger at a party what they do for work is fine, but asking them how much they get paid is likely crossing the line. The flip side of this is also true though. Once a relationship has reached a certain stage, asking more intimate or detailed questions &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inc.com/shelley-prevost/25-revealing-questions-that-build-better-relationships-at-work.html&quot;&gt;can be the key to unlocking that relationship’s potential&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(To briefly break my own rule and talk tech, this point is why progressive profiling can be so effective.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone shares information in confidence, the best way to ruin that relationship is to gossip or spread that information to others. In the realm of online relationships, this is why data privacy is so incredibly important. On top of that, while 2nd and 3rd party data sharing services exist, the value of these should be weighed heavily against the potential for betrayal of trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology is inherently neither good nor bad, but rather an enabler for people. In the case of personalization technology, mass communications are beginning to feel ever closer to conversations with individuals. As the holder of these tools, you can choose to treat those individual with respect, and in so doing build trust, or you can disregard the relationship and break trust. Which will you choose?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Marketing Science]]></title><description><![CDATA[The other day my niece asked me what the steps are of the scientific method.

I responded with &quot;form a hypothesis and run an experiment&quot;, but
she wasn&apos;t satisfied. There was something with a &quot;P&quot; word in there and she
wanted to get all of the steps right. When I googled the steps, numerous
elementary school websites appeared, expounding on the steps of the
scientific method, which both gave me hope for our next generation of scientists,
and also got me wondering about who else was missing some steps from the scientific
method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about this exchange later, and how essential it is for marketers
to think about and follow the steps of the scientific method when working on their
websites and other marketing materials. The proliferation of A/B testing tools over
the past few years has made one step much easier, but the value of these tools is
greatly diminished without a proper grounding in the scientific method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So without further adieu, here are the steps as defined &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method&quot;&gt;on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make Observations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think of Interesting Questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formulate Hypotheses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop Testable Predictions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gather Data to Test Predictions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refine, Alter, Expand or Reject Hypotheses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat 4 through 6 as necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop General Theories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Scientific_Method_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Scientific Method&quot; title=&quot;The Scientific Method&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to talk to each one of these, but the tl;dr of this article is that
most examples I see focus only on running lots of experiments (step 5), but they miss
doing it in such a way that general theories can be established. This is a greatly
missed opportunity and should be remedied post haste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-observations&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#make-observations&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Make Observations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ll never see anything interesting unless you stop, open your eyes, and pay
attention. Opportunities for getting to know your audience abound in both the
physical world and online. Surveying your users and performing user testing
(made far easier with services like &lt;a href=&quot;http://usertesting.com&quot;&gt;usertesting.com&lt;/a&gt;) are
excellent places to start. Web analytics tools such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com/analytics&quot;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href=&quot;http://kissmetrics.com&quot;&gt;Kissmetrics&lt;/a&gt; are also indispensable in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are entire professions dedicated to both user testing and advanced analytics,
and this step should be taken very seriously. If you&apos;re not taking enough time
on this today, be sure to block off time to just stop and observe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you observe, questions will undoubtedly begin to form. Write them down and
continue to ask more. If you see something interesting, ask why, then ask why
again. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys&quot;&gt;ask why five times&lt;/a&gt; and
you&apos;ll undoubtedly get somewhere of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;formulate-hypotheses&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#formulate-hypotheses&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Formulate Hypotheses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only with a well formed hypothesis will you be able to make accurate statements
in following steps. A good hypothesis has the end game of a general theory in
mind, not just a question of &quot;which image will work better in my call to action?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good hypothesis could look like &quot;my audience will respond better to casual
than formal language.&quot; What makes this a good one? It leads to easily testable
predictions as well as the potential of a general theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;develop-testable-predictions&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#develop-testable-predictions&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Develop Testable Predictions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A testable prediction is a smaller unit than a hypothesis. In other words, if
the hypothesis says &quot;I think this is the general rule&quot;, the prediction says
&quot;using this specific piece of language will perform better than this other
specific piece of language.&quot; Once you get that far, you&apos;re ready to launch an
experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;gather-data-to-test-predictions&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#gather-data-to-test-predictions&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Gather Data to Test Predictions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running the actual experiment can be done in many different ways. There are
dedicated A/B testing solutions such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://optimizely.com&quot;&gt;Optimizely&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;http://vwo.com&quot;&gt;Visual Website Optimizer&lt;/a&gt; for the web, but many other tools
include A/B testing such as personalization solutions, email marketing tools
and landing page tools. There are also many open source testing frameworks that
can be used to perform this step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important part is that you set up a system that allows you to run a lot of
tests often. This will pay dividends over time, as you&apos;ll see in the next steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;refine-alter-expand-or-reject-hypotheses&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#refine-alter-expand-or-reject-hypotheses&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Refine, Alter, Expand or Reject Hypotheses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single experiment isn&apos;t enough to form a general theory or to reject a hypothesis.
There are far too many confounding conditions for that to be the case. For example,
let&apos;s say you run an experiment on your home page using the hypothesis that friendly
language is better than formal language, and your testable prediction is that
the phrase &quot;Hey y&apos;all, how can we help?&quot; will perform better than &quot;Visit our
support page for assistance&quot;. It is indeed true that one phrase is more casual
and the other more formal, but perhaps the former phrase is too colloquial for
your audience or it has gone too far. Casual language &lt;em&gt;in general&lt;/em&gt; may indeed
be better than formal, but not in this &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other things can &quot;go wrong&quot; with your test as well. For example, a large conference
in the Southern United States during the week that you run this test may lead to
a large group of people finding the &quot;hey y&apos;all&quot; language to be preferable, but
the next week as the characteristics of your audience change, this can no longer
be the case. So as you see results from an initial test, you should refine and
expand your original hypothesis to get to something sufficiently accurate that
can be answered. Surprising effects can also be found in this way, often leading
to cases where personalization can be employed to speak to different kinds of
people in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;repeat-4-through-6-as-necessary&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#repeat-4-through-6-as-necessary&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Repeat 4 through 6 as necessary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually you&apos;ll want to either accept or reject your overall hypothesis, and
the importance of the question will help dictate how many different tests should
be run. For example, if you&apos;re trying to determine the overall tone of language
to use in all marketing materials, this warrants many carefully planned tests
as this could effect the overall trajectory of your business. If, however, you&apos;re
simply trying to determine the optimal size or color of a specific button, the
risk of getting that wrong is likely smaller and can be answered in a few short
iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General theories are the gold you are mining for when embarking on an optimization
plan. In the physical sciences, generalized theories about physics led to a world
where man could walk on the moon. While perhaps less lofty, generalized theories
of audience behavior can lead to far greater benefits in business than simply
testing everything you can think of. If you can prove over many experiments that
a certain tone of voice in your marketing material truly leads to a substantial
lift in conversions, then you can use that knowledge in all your materials and
move on to testing other questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running lots of experiments can have some value, but keeping in mind the greater
picture and thinking like a scientist will provide far greater rewards in the
long term. Work towards general theories about your brand, your market or your
audience and you will get far more out of your investment in optimization and
personalization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Six Degrees of Personalization]]></title><description><![CDATA[I spend a lot of my time talking and thinking about personalization. If you

If you
know that data driven personalization and experimentation is something you
should be doing but don&apos;t really know where to start or how to get there, then
you&apos;re decidedly in the majority. Most organizations are doing a fairly good
job of collecting a lot of data, a smaller number are excelling at understanding
the data. Very few are activating that data in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I aim to lay out six steps that go from the very beginning to
using data like the best of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-get-the-data&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1-get-the-data&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1. Get the Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sounds easy enough, right? You are probably collecting mountains of data
already in the form of web analytics, CRM, email marketing, POS, and more.
That&apos;s a great start, but there might be a missing step. If all of that data
is living in separate silos, it&apos;s going to be quite difficult to gain the
level of insight that you really need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of great tools on the market that help solve this problem. The
(somewhat) new &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2790010?hl=en&quot;&gt;Universal Analytics&lt;/a&gt; from Google is a great place to start. There are also a myriad of Business
Intelligence tools out there focussed on the problem from different angles
such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://looker.com&quot;&gt;Looker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://domo.com&quot;&gt;Domo&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://gooddata.com&quot;&gt;GoodData&lt;/a&gt; just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major consideration here is getting all the data into a consistent format
that makes sense when you query between these different sources. Depending
on your tool, you will either need to do that before pushing the data into
the system, or the tool may have data cleaning capabilities. If you have a
lot of data to clean up, you might consider a tool like
&lt;a href=&quot;http://paxata.com&quot;&gt;Paxata&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://alteryx.com&quot;&gt;Alteryx&lt;/a&gt; to make that a
lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-understand-the-data&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2-understand-the-data&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2. Understand the Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have data, what do you do with it? This is probably the hardest
question of this whole post, and the one where organizations are most likely
to go wrong. Having loads of data often leads people to find &quot;truths&quot; that
aren&apos;t there. Spurious correlations run rampant in business and in life, and
if you don&apos;t take the time to dig deeper, you may be in trouble down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly understanding your data, and understanding it well, is going to take time.
If you are fortunate enough to have a full BI team in your organization, then
you can ask lots of deep questions. If you&apos;re new to this and are working
within a smaller team, take your time and look at the data from a lot of
different directions. Slice, sort and pivot the data in as many ways you can
think of until you start to see the patterns like &lt;a href=&quot;http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/matrix/images/d/dc/Cypher_Talks_with_Neo.png/revision/latest?cb=20130215031028&quot;&gt;Cypher reading the Matrix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-run-some-experiments&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3-run-some-experiments&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;3. Run some experiments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the very best way to gain knowledge about your visitors, or just about
anything for that matter, is through scientific experimentation. On the web,
we typically call this an A/B test, but your mindset should be that of a
scientist seeking to gain insight. This mindset has implications that not
all practitioners of A/B testing tools will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s what I mean: You can run an experiment on your home page to see whether
&quot;Free&quot; converts better than &quot;Get it today&quot; or an orange button beats a blue
button. You can start that experiment, and wait until your tool says you have
a &quot;winner&quot; (more on this dangerous topic in a future blog post). Once you have
decided the blue beats the orange, you can implement that on your button and
move on. What have you just learned? That your visitors like the color blue?
Maybe. It is very unlikely that you&apos;ve learned enough at this point if you
didn&apos;t start with a well formed hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s say you&apos;re interested in increasing clicks on a call to action (CTA) on
your home page. Rather than simply making changes, start by stating some
assumptions and some possible changes that might effect users behavior. Is the
button you want them to click on sufficiently visible? What else might be
competing for its attention? If your visitor does notice the button, is it
clearly communicating what will happen when they click on it? Do they have any
reason to be nervous about what will happen? If you can answer these questions
first, then you can move to changes that you could make that, if your hypothesis
is correct, would improve your conversions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you&apos;re ready to run an experiment, but don&apos;t just stop at one. If you think
the button isn&apos;t visible enough, try changing its color in one experiment,
making it bigger in another, and making something else &lt;em&gt;smaller&lt;/em&gt; in another.
If you&apos;re right that people were missing the button before, then you should
see significant results with each one of these changes. If you don&apos;t see those
results, then you&apos;ve also learned a valuable lesson: It&apos;s not about visibility.
You can now safely move on to changing wording or other messaging that might
be creating friction in order to improve the results, and you may have even
learned some valuable lessons about your visitors themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-segment-and-target-your-audience&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4-segment-and-target-your-audience&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4. Segment and target your audience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&apos;m going to let you in on a little secret: Not all your visitors are the
same. Of course, you already knew that. If you stop and think about it, there
probably aren&apos;t many things more obvious. But due to technical limitations of
the past and lack of resources in the present, we often think about our visitors
as one big homogenous group and give them all the same content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really great websites in the past have addressed this problem through great
information architecture, allowing all the different visitors to quickly
find the content that they are looking for. Really great websites of the
present do that as well, but they go a step further by personalizing a web site
to the needs and desires of the current visitor, in the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than just serving your visitor&apos;s needs though, segmentation allows you
to dive deeper into understanding. So once you&apos;ve built a segment, say drilling
down to geography, past behavior or device type, go and run more experiments
within that segment and refine the experience for each group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-repeat-steps-1-through-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#5-repeat-steps-1-through-4&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;5. Repeat steps 1 through 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;ve ever thought personalization or A/B testing were tools you installed
on your site, you were mistaken. Personalization is a mindset; a process; a
way of life. Ok, maybe not a way of life .. but it&apos;s most definitely a process
and one that takes time and iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t loose heart though, small experiments and small personalization can have
huge impact on your bottom line. Focus on learning, refining, and always
moving forward, and the return on investment of your time and resources will
be well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-trusting-the-machine&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#6-trusting-the-machine&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;6. Trusting the machine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of buzz in the personalization space centers around machine learning and
automated content recommendation techniques a la Facebook, Netflix and Google
advertising. I find this area of research to be incredibly exciting and in the
right situations believe it can be incredibly powerful. I want to give a few
caveats here before the excitement runs away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, machine learning carries with it a trade-off. On one hand, you
can have complex blended models that are incredibly accurate in predicting user
behavior. On the other hand, you can have predictions that are easy to
interpret. Sometimes you can have a nice blend, but the algorithms used by
the best prediction algorithms will teach you very little about the behavior
of your users, or how to plan your next piece of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, how many times have you been frustrated with the inaccuracy of a
recommendation from Netflix or Facebook? If you&apos;re anything like me, it&apos;s
rather frequent. Now, not many organizations have a data team on par with
these, so if you expect that switching on a black box recommendation algorithm
will instantly give your site through the roof conversion rates, you will
likely have a bad day when the data comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, if you have a large amount of great content and a lot of different
kinds of visitors, then a manual process of segmentation and targeting for
each type of visitor can quickly become impractical. If that is the case,
then you should be looking at automated recommendation software, of which there
are some really great options out there. Automated recommendations should always
be used in tandem with a solid practice of data collection, understanding and
experimentation though, so that you don&apos;t miss out on the evolutionary process
that your site can take described in the rest of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do great things with data. Whether you&apos;re just starting to think about
personalization or have been doing it for a decade, there are always ways of
improving. Focus on the process and the learnings that you can achieve from
using these tools. Ask good questions. Dive deep into the data. And above all,
have fun!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello World]]></title><description><![CDATA[For anyone who has programmed, those two words--Hello World--mean an awful lot.
