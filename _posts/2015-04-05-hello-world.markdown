<p>For anyone who has programmed, those two words--Hello World--mean an awful lot. They mean taking the first steps towards something new and exciting. They mean a recognition that there is no shame in starting small down a new adventure that can take you as far as your imagination will allow.</p>

<p>It is with this excitement that I launch this new blog, where I can share my thoughts on technology, data, life and more. I am forever curious and forever learning, and I hope that as you read these posts that you will learn something that will change you and make your life better, even ever so slightly. Do enjoy.</p>
