<blockquote>
&ldquo;Truth is great and will prevail if left to herself, that she is the proper and sufficient antagonist to error, and has nothing to fear from the conflict, unless by human interposition disarmed of her natural weapons, free argument and debate; errors ceasing to be dangerous when it is permitted freely to contradict them&rdquo;
<br />
<em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -- Thomas Jefferson</em>
</blockquote>

<p>Thomas Jefferson wrote those words in his modestly titled "Notes on the State of Virginia". At the time, he was speaking primarily of the freedoms of speech and religion which he viewed as absolutely essential in the new collonies. While these words are from a very different time and place, I find them incredibly inspiring as I search for the truth in all things and in all ways that I know how.</p>

<p>To that end, I am constantly curious and always learning what I can about the world around me. In my work, this has lead me into a wide variety of technology, and most recently to the study of data and data science as applied to the Intenet and Personalization. In other parts of my life, this has lead me through the study of Political Science, Psychology, Philosiphy and Religion, and leaves me ever thirsty for knowledge and wisdom.</p>

<p>I live in Massachusetts with my wife and 3 young boys. They inspire me and fill my life with love, joy, and never a dull moment.</p>

<p>I work as a Product Manager at <a href="http://www.acquia.com">Acquia, Inc</a> and focus mainly on <a href="https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-lift">Acquia Lift</a>, a product I helped to build and am quite passionate about.</a>

<p>I hope that you find inspiration and knowledge in something that I have to say in this page. If you'd like to contact me, feel free to reach out via the contact page or social media links below</p>
