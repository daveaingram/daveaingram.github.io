There was something with a "P" word in there and she\nwanted to get all of the steps right. When I googled the steps, numerous\nelementary school websites appeared, expounding on the steps of the\nscientific method, which both gave me hope for our next generation of scientists,\nand also got me wondering about who else was missing some steps from the scientific\nmethod.</p>\n<p>I was thinking about this exchange later, and how essential it is for marketers\nto think about and follow the steps of the scientific method when working on their\nwebsites and other marketing materials. The proliferation of A/B testing tools over\nthe past few years has made one step much easier, but the value of these tools is\ngreatly diminished without a proper grounding in the scientific method.</p>\n<p>So without further adieu, here are the steps as defined <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">on Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make Observations</li>\n<li>Think of Interesting Questions</li>\n<li>Formulate Hypotheses</li>\n<li>Develop Testable Predictions</li>\n<li>Gather Data to Test Predictions</li>\n<li>Refine, Alter, Expand or Reject Hypotheses</li>\n<li>Repeat 4 through 6 as necessary</li>\n<li>Develop General Theories</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src="/images/Scientific_Method_3.jpg" alt="The Scientific Method" title="The Scientific Method"></p>\n<p>I want to talk to each one of these, but the tl;dr of this article is that\nmost examples I see focus only on running lots of experiments (step 5), but they miss\ndoing it in such a way that general theories can be established. This is a greatly\nmissed opportunity and should be remedied post haste.</p>\n<h2 id="make-observations"><a href="#make-observations" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Make Observations</h2>\n<p>You\'ll never see anything interesting unless you stop, open your eyes, and pay\nattention.

There are\ndedicated A/B testing solutions such as <a href="http://optimizely.com">Optimizely</a> or\n<a href="http://vwo.com">Visual Website Optimizer</a> for the web, but many other tools\ninclude A/B testing such as personalization solutions, email marketing tools\nand landing page tools. There are also many open source testing frameworks that\ncan be used to perform this step.</p>\n<p>The important part is that you set up a system that allows you to run a lot of\ntests often. This will pay dividends over time, as you\'ll see in the next steps.</p>\n<h2 id="refine-alter-expand-or-reject-hypotheses"><a href="#refine-alter-expand-or-reject-hypotheses" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Refine, Alter, Expand or Reject Hypotheses</h2>\n<p>A single experiment isn\'t enough to form a general theory or to reject a hypothesis.\nThere are far too many confounding conditions for that to be the case. For example,\nlet\'s say you run an experiment on your home page using the hypothesis that friendly\nlanguage is better than formal language, and your testable prediction is that\nthe phrase "Hey y\'all, how can we help?" will perform better than "Visit our\nsupport page for assistance". It is indeed true that one phrase is more casual\nand the other more formal, but perhaps the former phrase is too colloquial for\nyour audience or it has gone too far. Casual language <em>in general</em> may indeed\nbe better than formal, but not in this <em>specific</em> case.</p>\n<p>Other things can "go wrong" with your test as well. For example, a large conference\nin the Southern United States during the week that you run this test may lead to\na large group of people finding the "hey y\'all" language to be preferable, but\nthe next week as the characteristics of your audience change, this can no longer\nbe the case. So as you see results from an initial test, you should refine and\nexpand your original hypothesis to get to something sufficiently accurate that\ncan be answered. Surprising effects can also be found in this way, often leading\nto cases where personalization can be employed to speak to different kinds of\npeople in different ways.</p>\n<h2 id="repeat-4-through-6-as-necessary"><a href="#repeat-4-through-6-as-necessary" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Repeat 4 through 6 as necessary</h2>\n<p>Eventually you\'ll want to either accept or reject your overall hypothesis, and\nthe importance of the question will help dictate how many different tests should\nbe run. For example, if you\'re trying to determine the overall tone of language\nto use in all marketing materials, this warrants many carefully planned tests\nas this could effect the overall trajectory of your business. If, however, you\'re\nsimply trying to determine the optimal size or color of a specific button, the\nrisk of getting that wrong is likely smaller and can be answered in a few short\niterations.</p>\n<h2 id="develop-general-theories"><a href="#develop-general-theories" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Develop General Theories</h2>\n<p>General theories are the gold you are mining for when embarking on an optimization\nplan.
