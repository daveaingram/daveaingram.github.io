The basic premise is that instead of asking a question and brainstorming answers, you brainstorm better questions. This leads to more open creativity and broader participation from more people.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"When you're a student, you're judged by how well you answer questions. Somebody\nelse asks the questions, and if you give good answers, you'll get a good grade.\nBut in life, you're judged by how good your questions are.\"\n-- <cite><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/03/better-brainstorming\">Robert Langer</a></cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This got me thinking: What areas in my life could I be asking better questions?\nFor me, I think about my life in the context of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Family</li>\n<li>Myself</li>\n<li>Work</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In work / business, we use brainstorming often enough that the applications seem pretty clear. I can certainly apply this while working on new products or when trying to determine the best path forward with a software feature or with an organizational challenge. When we moved down to Charleston though, we used a business technique (<a href=\"/moving-to-charleston\">SWOT analysis</a> -- nerdy, I know) in order to help make our decision, so I'm wondering how I can apply this to my non work life as well. So with my family life and thinking about myself, here are some questions I can think of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are some things you're doing today that you'll regret in 6 months?</li>\n<li>What are some things you're not planning to do today that you'll wish you had 6 months from now?</li>\n<li>Is my family happy today?</li>\n<li>What could I do today for my kids health? What about my own?</li>\n<li>Am I living up to my potential?</li>\n<li>If I could make different choices this year than I did last year, what would they be?</li>\n<li>Is there anything stopping me from making those choices today?</li>\n<li>What's the most important thing you could do right now?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ok, with that last question .. I'm going to walk away from my computer and go play with my 5 year old.</p>",timeToRead:1,excerpt:"I just finished reading an excellent article on  Better Brainstorming in HBR .
