Well, we can calculate it exactly with a bit of Kinematics at Newton's second law above, but if you really want to follow along, this guy can explain it better than me:</p>\\n<div>\\n          <div\\n            class=\\\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\\\"\\n            style=\\\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\\\"\\n          >\\n            <iframe src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vWGAKpP_WcE\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"autoplay; encrypted-media\\\" allowfullscreen style=\\\"\\n            position: absolute;\\n            top: 0;\\n            left: 0;\\n            width: 100%;\\n            height: 100%;\\n          \\\"></iframe>\\n          </div>\\n          </div>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>But we're in business here and we're really just going for the principal, which is that an object moving twice as fast will take <em>four times as much stopping power</em>. That's an exponential increase, and gives us all the more reason to check if something's working before it's plowing along like a freight train.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"why-agile-works\\\"><a href=\\\"#why-agile-works\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Why Agile Works</h2>\\n<p>Agile works in software development and numerous other areas in life and business because it keeps problems small enough that your team can accelerate quickly, and stop or change direction when required. It's really fairly intuitive, and if you've tried it you've seen the advantages as well. Still, it's nice to know that Newton's got your back.</p>\",\"timeToRead\":3,\"excerpt\":\"So here's a fun little idea.
